After way too much ado, James and Angie's travel blog is finally set-up.

The reason it's taken so long is James has spend far too long playing with the guts of the site and making elaborate image handling worflows

# Where we are now

Right now I'm sitting in a Tea house called Orienth√©, in Montreal - sucking up their upload limit, trying to offload some of the 300 or so photos we've taken so far.

To get to Montreal we've come via Vancouver, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan region in British Columbia - the naturally stunning westernmost state of Canada.

## Vancouver Island

Our first stop off the plane from Sydney was technically in Vancouver, for a terrible cup of cofee, but only on the way from Vancouver airport to the [Tsawassen](https://goo.gl/maps/53z4I) ferry to Nanaimo - a small harbour town on the eastern shore of Vancouver Island.

Although there was snow on the mountains in the distance, to the north west of Vancouver, it wasn't cold at all - if you don't count the wind on the top deck of the ferry that is.

### Vancouver Island, Nanaimo

Although we got off the ferry in Nanaimo, I hadn't slept for over 36 hours by this point and I wanted nothing more than to find our Air BnB accomodation in [LadySmith](https://goo.gl/maps/g4A6l "google maps link")

We eventually made it back to Nanaimo, as that seemed like the largest local town to where we were staying.
