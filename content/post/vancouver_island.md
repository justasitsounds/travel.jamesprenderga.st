# Vancouver Island

Our first stop off the plane from Sydney was technically in Vancouver, for a terrible cup of cofee, but only on the way from Vancouver airport to the [Tsawassen](https://goo.gl/maps/53z4I) ferry to Nanaimo - a small harbour town on the eastern shore of Vancouver Island.

Although there was snow on the mountains in the distance, to the north west of Vancouver, it wasn't cold at all - if you don't count the wind on the top deck of the ferry that is.

### Nanaimo

Although we got off the ferry in Nanaimo, I hadn't slept for over 36 hours by this point and I wanted nothing more than to find our Air BnB accomodation in [LadySmith](https://goo.gl/maps/g4A6l "google maps link")

We eventually made it back to Nanaimo, as that seemed like the largest local town to where we were staying. Very quiet, sleepy seaside town. We had fish and chips at a place floating in the marina - the occasional waft of bilge and rotting fish didn't make them very palatable.

### Duncan

The next day we stopped off in a little town called Duncan, for breakfast. To my horror, the place that we ended up going to was a Vegan Cafe that served bad coffee and NO BACON!

### Cowichan (cow) Valley

Found a nice winery, with some very nice local wines, made from hybrids unique to Vancouver Island that will tolerate the very short growing season and cold temperatures

The winery had a permaculturish ethos and theye had chickens running between the vines

### [Kinsol trestle bridge](http://www.cvrd.bc.ca/index.aspx?NID=1379)

We discovered this bridge somewhat randomly as we were just looking for a short hike/walk in the glorious spring sunshine and we were pointed to this place by the winery staff. It's one of the worlds largest standing wooden trestle bridges. Originally a railway bridge, it fell out of use when the mine it served was no longer economical in the 1980s, but was later repaired and largely rebuilt in 2007-2008 as a footbridge and is now part of the Cowichan valley hiking trail

### Victoria

Our last stop in Vancouver Island was Victoria, not only the island's main city, but surprisingly also the capital of British Columbia - surprising because it's about a fifth the size of Vancouver, just an hour's ferry ride away.

#### Harbour

After walking though chi-town we went down to the harbour to get some lunch at a harbourside chippy called 'Red fish, blue fish'. It proved to be very popular and we ended up queueing for over half an hour, in the surprisingly fierce sunshine.
